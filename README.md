# C-Assembly-Instruction-Interpreter-and-Memory-Manager
Developed a C++ project that interprets a sequence of Assembly-like instructions read from a text file. The project includes a memory management system that stores these instructions in a read-only memory (ROM). Implemented functionalities facilitate handling individual instructions, such as storing and retrieving values from memory, performing arithmetic operations, printing values, and ensuring proper program termination. The focus was on crafting clean, maintainable code while optimizing the execution of these instructions.
